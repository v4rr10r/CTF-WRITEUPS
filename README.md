A fun beginner-friendly CTF challenge where students must recover the DSA experiments in a slightly indirect way.
The ELF binary prints hidden coordinates that, when visualized on Desmos, reveal the password needed to unlock a protected 7z archive.
After extracting the archive, a Python script auto-fills the student’s Name and SAP ID into multiple experiment files.
